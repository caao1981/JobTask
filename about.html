Our Journey
Our journey began when our Founder, Kundayi Matambanadzo, operated as a Sole Trader. During this time, he personally experienced and listened to countless customer complaints about other service providers – challenges that won't be detailed here for obvious reasons. Recognizing an industry gap and the need for a paradigm shift in service standards, JobTask was born.

Founder's Statement
Revolutionizing Service Excellence with a Smile
“At JobTask, we've transformed customer frustrations into our driving force. With relentless dedication and a commitment to mastery, I, Kundayi Matambanadzo, embarked on a journey armed with little more than a determined spirit, a resilient laptop, and a vision.

With years of hands-on experience in the service industry, I understood the need for a platform that would redefine standards and exceed customer expectations. This journey gave birth to JobTask - a platform where your needs are the centerpiece of our mission. From the first click to the final completion, our dedication to excellence shines through, and yes, there might have been a laptop or two that barely survived the journey.

Our journey reflects the relentless pursuit of quality, efficiency, and innovation.

I welcome you to join us in experiencing the JobTask difference, where your satisfaction is the heart of our success.”
